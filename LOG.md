# mado-shokunin — Iteration Log

- 2026-10-14 — round 0: minted as shonen (operator directive; see MINT.md).
  Probation: >=3 verified rounds before any roster row.
- 2026-10-14 — round 1: probation wave 1 (content lanes + audits dispatched
  from the mint session; dispatch write-scopes left this LOG to the scribe
  lane). Round-1 work sits uncommitted in the working tree
  (` M SKILL.md`, `?? corpus/knowledge/`) together with these three record
  files — landed-means-committed is for the wave integrator's commit
  (observation). Deliverables:
  MADO-1 → `corpus/knowledge/hyprland-config-plane.md` (217 L by `wc -l`):
  hypr inventory, include graph (17 `source` statements, `hyprland.conf` a
  pure orchestrator), override chain proven by `hyprctl getoption`
  (`general:gaps_out` 0 via toggle, not user `looknfeel.conf`;
  `input:kb_layout` br), 192 binds = 23+4+90+50+25 closing exactly,
  separate consumers (hypridle inactive, cause UNK §12), version pins §9,
  spot-checks §13.
  MADO-2 → `corpus/knowledge/waybar-walker-plane.md` (364 L): waybar/walker/
  mako/swayosd/idle-lock plane, style-vs-module reload split
  (`config.jsonc:2`), drift-vs-stock diff §6, falsifiable decision table §7,
  unknowns §8, rejections kept §9 (SUPER+SPACE ≠ Omarchy menu vs live list),
  errata §10.
  MADO-3 → `corpus/knowledge/terminals-and-omarchy.md` (179 L): only
  Alacritty installed of the four terminals; theme plane owns colors outside
  user configs (`theme.name` → matte-black); omarchy skill anatomy (392 L)
  incl. hooks drift — skill text shows flat files where the host has five
  `*.d` dirs (§7).
  Fourth deliverable → `SKILL.md` distillation (no lane header in the diff;
  authoring lane unknown to this scribe): seed 22 → 186 L (169 insertions,
  `git diff --stat`) — who-owns-it table 19 rows, read-only probe table
  15 rows, 6 mutating commands fenced operator-only, omarchy-boundary
  routing table 5 rows; every row citing MADO-N § anchors or omarchy-skill
  line anchors.
  Scribe verification (this entry; all commands re-run 2026-10-14):
  seed-vs-tree counts — `git show 74d3b7b:SKILL.md | wc -l` → 22 with 0
  table lines; tree SKILL.md → 186 L, 45 table lines across 3 tables;
  anchor spot-checks resolve — omarchy skill `wc -l` → 392 and `:300-305` =
  window-rules wiki re-fetch, `hyprland.conf:29` = `source =
  ~/.config/hypr/ai-usage.conf`; live pins corroborated — `hyprctl version`
  → 0.56.2, `omarchy version` → 3.8.3; probe-tool existence sweep 10/10 on
  PATH (hyprctl omarchy makoctl busctl grim slurp hyprpicker systemctl pgrep
  jq). Records written by this scribe: corpus/README.md coverage map 3 rows;
  SCORECARD move-log round-1 rows (coverage, operability) with counting
  commands.
  Observations: (a) the note files end without a trailing newline, so editor
  line counts (218/365/180, as quoted in SKILL.md "Round 1 sources") =
  `wc -l` + 1 (217/364/179) — quoting convention, not a defect, but counts
  should name their command; (b) `SHONEN.md` deviates from the canonical
  seed (PROTOCOL.md:419-428): header "# mado-shokunin — probation checklist"
  vs "# <name> — Promotion checklist", boxes paraphrased despite the file's
  "verbatim shape" claim — shared by all four lanes minted 09:50 today
  (header shape checked, contents not read); mint-time defect, flag for the
  operator / promotion gate — outside this entry's write scope;
  (c) `corpus/lessons/` is still empty — no `lessons/round-1.md` landed
  in-repo this round (CORPUS.md layout expects per-round lessons; the wave's
  knowledge landed under `knowledge/` instead).
  Unknowns: which lane authored the SKILL.md distillation; whether wave
  artifacts exist outside this repo (`.ufo/` checked shape-only, contents
  not read).
  Falsifiable next-iterations: an executable checklist + a first committed
  verdict gate (the operability ceiling named in SCORECARD round 1);
  verifier wiring for the SHONEN boxes; `lessons/round-2.md` to start the
  lessons ledger.
